                  We are past the theory of global death. For every minute you read this, dozens of acres of woodlands
                  are disapearing. As
                  the forest shrinks, the world shrinks. Life drpping dry.

                        Sometimes nature causes fires, but other times the worst fires are caused by
                        careless people. There are

                        ways to
                        reduce fires. Not having gender reveal parties in nature is one way.

                  Emmerse yourself in nature. Even getting away a quarter of a mile into a park with lots of trees will
                  bring up the air
                  quality and you will smell the difference. People feel a sense of calm when in a park with lots of
                  trees
                  and are able to
                  breathe better. Not just from pollution, but also from stress. Trees are our gaurdians.

                     Make
                     sure to put some heavy duty gloves on before touch any trash. Use a trash bag and a
                     pick-up-stick.
                     You'd be surprised how much of a difference it'll make. Recruit some friends and ask them to
